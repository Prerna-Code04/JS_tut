following chai aur code ka js tut by hitesh sir

# Notes taking from office!
Functions:
 f(a,b){ #a and b are parameters
    SOMETHING SOMETHING
 }

 f(3,5) #here 3 and 5 are called arguments

 If a function is defined and has only one parameter and returning that but when I call it i pass 3 args, then it wont show error, will simply return the `st argument entered.

 any scope outside a block is GLOBAL scope and its acccessible everywhere but the block scope are not accessible outside that block (exceptio: var and c=40 types)

inw idnows, when we go inspect and console then global scope is different there and similalry its diff for when we execute the code with node
